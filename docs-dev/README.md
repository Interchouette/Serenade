## Design rules

1. **Choice, not prescription** - persistence, ORM, HTTP server for the _application_ are application decisions. Serenade exposes contracts and adapters.
2. **Kernel vs product** - Serenade owns cross-cutting infrastructure; products own domain (commerce, CMS, etc.).
3. **Bundles compose components** - like Symfony bundles, not monolithic framework magic.
4. **Explicit extension points** - events, tagged services, middleware; Wasm host **plumbing** in Serenade ([WASM.md](WASM.md)), WIT/sandbox **ABI and fixtures** at the product layer.

## Related product

[RustaShop](https://github.com/Interchouette-ITC/RustaShop) documents its own HTTP house pattern (Actix kernel + Axum MCP) in `docs-dev/FOUNDATIONS.md`. That is a **RustaShop** choice, not a Serenade requirement.

| [#30](https://github.com/Interchouette-ITC/Serenade/issues/30) | Flex-like recipes and app scaffolding |
| [#56](https://github.com/Interchouette-ITC/Serenade/issues/56) | Web Debug Toolbar / Profiler (logs + DB/query panels) |
| [#57](https://github.com/Interchouette-ITC/Serenade/issues/57) | Observability / structured logging (Monolog-like) |
| [#110](https://github.com/Interchouette-ITC/Serenade/issues/110) | Forms, CSRF, HTML escape |
| [#111](https://github.com/Interchouette-ITC/Serenade/issues/111) | View helpers (`path` / `asset` / partials) |
| [#112](https://github.com/Interchouette-ITC/Serenade/issues/112) | MyFeed beginner demo (`examples/MyFeed`) |

Config packages prefer **TOML**; console is the `bin/console` analogue (optional ratatui for rich TUI). Composer maps to **Cargo**, not a second package manager.

Consumer: [RustaShop #49](https://github.com/Interchouette-ITC/RustaShop/issues/49).
